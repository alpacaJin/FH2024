# Lumi's quest: Revival

## Created for FullyHacks 2024 -- Cool Game Sub-Category Winner

In a once vibrant part of the ocean, the Coralia Reef, a mysterious blight has begun to bleach the corals, draining them of their life and color. The reef's guardians, the Luminescent Corals, possess the ancient power of the ocean's hues but are rooted in place and cannot spread their vitality to their bleached kin.

Enter Lumi, a bright and courageous angelfish with a unique bio-luminescent nose, a gift from the Luminescent Corals for its brave heart. Lumin is the reef's last hope. Its mission is to gather the colors from the guardians and restore life to the reef, piece by piece.

However, time is of the essence. Dark clouds of pollution are approaching, and without the reef's full vibrancy to protect it, the entire ocean is at risk. Lumin must navigate the dangers, solve the color-based puzzles, and revive the reef to save its underwater world.
